Machine Controller Manager (MCM) manages VMs as another kubernetes custom resource. It provides a declarative way to manage VMs. The current implementation supports AWS, GCP, Azure and Openstack. It can easily extended to support other cloud providers as well.

Example of managing machine:
```
kubectl create/get/delete machine vm1
```

### Key terminologies

Nodes/Machines/VMs are different terminologies used to represent similar things. We use these terms in the following way

1. VM: A virtual machine running on any cloud provider.
1. Node: Native kubernetes node objects. The objects you get to see when you do a *"kubectl get nodes"*. Although nodes can be either physical/virtual machines, for the purposes of our discussions it refers to a VM.
1. Machine: A VM that is provisioned/managed by the Machine Controller Manager.
