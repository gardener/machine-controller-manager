# Go modules are not able to properly vendor k8s.io/code-generator@kubernetes-1.12.1 (build with godep)
# to include also generate-internal-groups.sh scripts under vendor/.
# However this is fixed with kubernetes-1.15.0 (k8s.io/code-generator@kubernetes-1.15.0 is opted in go modules).
# The workaround for now is to have a kubernetes-1.12.1 copy of generate-internal-groups.sh under hack/code-generator and
# to copy them to vendor/k8s.io/code-generator/ for the generation.
# And respectively clean up them after execution.
# The workaround should be removed adopting kubernetes-1.15.0.
# Similar thing is also done in https://github.com/heptio/contour/pull/1010.
