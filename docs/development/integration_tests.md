# Integration tests

## Usage

## General setup & configurations

Integration tests for `machine-controller-manager-provider-{provider-name}` can be executed manually by following below steps.

1. Clone the repository `machine-controller-manager-provider-{provider-name}` on the local system.
1. Navigate to `machine-controller-manager-provider-{provider-name}` directory and create a `dev` sub-directory in it.
1. Create a `.env` file at the root of the `machine-controller-manager-provider-{provider-name}` project. This file serves as an environments file where all key-value pairs that are used in the `Makefile` are defined.
1. Copy the kubeconfig of the Control Cluster into `dev/control-kubeconfig.yaml` and add an entry in the `.env` file with `CONTROL_KUBECONFIG=dev/control-kubeconfig.yaml`. 
1. Add `CONTROL_NAMESPACE=<namespace of the control cluster>` to the `.env` file. This is the namespace that is used to deploy all resources and run tests.
1. (optional) Copy the kubeconfig of the Target Cluster into `dev/target-kubeconfig.yaml` and add an entry in the `.env` file with `TARGET_KUBECONFIG=dev/target-kubeconfig.yaml`.
1. If the tags on instances & associated resources on the provider are of `String` type (for example, GCP tags on its instances are of type `String` and not key-value pair) then add `TAGS_ARE_STRINGS := true` in the `Makefile` and export it. For GCP this has already been hard coded in the `Makefile`.
1. If the intention is to run any controllers in the control cluster, then `.env` should have at least one of `MCM_IMAGE` and `MC_IMAGE` defined. These images will be used along with `kubernetes/deployment.yaml` to deploy/update controllers in the Control Cluster. If the intention is to run the controllers locally then remove `MCM_IMAGE` and `MC_IMAGE` key-value pairs defined in `.env` and add `MACHINE_CONTROLLER_MANAGER_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=machine-controller-manager` in the `.env` file.
1. In order to apply the CRDs when the Control Cluster is a Gardener Shoot or if none of the controller images are specified, `machine-controller-manager` repository will be cloned automatically. Incase, this repository already exists in local system, then create a softlink as below which helps to test changes in `machine-controller-manager` quickly.
    ```bash
    ln -sf <path-for-machine-controller-manager-repo> dev/mcm
    ```
## Scenario based additional configurations
### Gardener Shoot as the Control Cluster 

If the Control Cluster is a Gardener Shoot cluster then,

1. Deploy a `Secret` named `test-mc-secret` (that contains the provider secret and cloud-config) in the `default` namespace of the Control Cluster.
1. Create a `dev/machineclassv1.yaml` file in the cloned repository and add an entry in the `.env` file with `MACHINECLASS_V1=dev/machineclassv1.yaml`. The name of the `MachineClass` itself should be `test-mc-v1`. The value of `providerSpec.secretRef.name` should be `test-mc-secret`. 
1. (Optional) Create an additional `dev/machineclassv2.yaml` file similar to above but with a bigger machine type and add an entry in the `.env` file with `MACHINECLASS_V2=dev/machineclassv2.yaml`.

### Gardener Seed as the Control Cluster 

If the Control Cluster is a Gardener SEED cluster, then the suite ideally employs the already existing `MachineClass` and Secrets. However,

1. (Optional) User can employ a custom `MachineClass` for the tests using below steps:
    1. Deploy a `Secret` named `test-mc-secret` (that contains the provider secret and cloud-config) in the shoot namespace of the Control Cluster. That is, the value of `metadata.namespace` should be `technicalID` of the Shoot and it will be of the pattern `shoot--<project>--<shoot-name>`.
    1. Create a `dev/machineclassv1.yaml` file and add an entry in the `.env` file with `MACHINECLASS_V1=dev/machineclassv1.yaml`.
        1. `providerSpec.secretRef.name` should refer the secret created in the previous step.
        1. `metadata.namespace` and `providerSpec.secretRef.namespace` should be `technicalID` (`shoot--<project>--<shoot-name>`) of the shoot.
        1.  The name of the `MachineClass` itself should be `test-mc-v1`.

## Running the tests

1. There is a rule `test-integration` in the `Makefile`, which can be used to start the integration test:
    ```bash
    $ make test-integration 
    Starting integration tests...
    Running Suite: Controller Suite
    ===============================
    ```
1. The controllers log files (`mcm_process.log` and `mc_process.log`) are stored in `.ci/controllers-test/logs` repo and can be used later.
## Adding Integration Tests for new providers

For a new provider, Running Integration tests works with no changes. But for the orphan resource test cases to work correctly, the provider-specific API calls and the Resource Tracker Interface (RTI) should be implemented. Please check [`machine-controller-manager-provider-aws`](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager-provider-aws/blob/master/test/integration/provider/) for reference.

## Extending integration tests

- Update [ControllerTests](../../pkg/test/integration/common/framework.go#L481) to be extend the testcases for all providers. Common testcases for machine|machineDeployment creation|deletion|scaling are packaged into [ControllerTests](../../pkg/test/integration/common/framework.go#L481).
- To extend the provider specfic test cases, the changes should be done in the `machine-controller-manager-provider-{provider-name}` repository. For example, to extended the testcases for `machine-controller-manager-provider-aws`, make changes to `test/integration/controller/controller_test.go` inside the `machine-controller-manager-provider-aws` repository. `commons` contains the `Cluster` and `Clientset` objects that makes it easy to extend the tests.
