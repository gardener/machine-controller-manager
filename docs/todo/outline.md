| If  the  design  is  influenced/copied  from  KCM  then  its  very  different.  There  are  different  controller  structs  defined  for  deployment,  replicaset  etc  which  makes  the  code  much  more  clearer.

| What  is  the  rationale  behind  a  timeout  of  10s?  If  the  API  server  is  not  up,  should  this  not  just  block  as  it  can  anyways  not  do  anything.  Also,  if  there  is  an  error  returned  then  you  exit  the  MCM  which  does  not  make  much  sense  actually  as  it  will  be  started  again  and  you  will  again  do  the  poll  for  the  API  server  to  come  back  up.

| Shoudn't  the  validation  of  the  machine  deployment  be  done  during  the  creation  via  a  validating  webhook  instead  of  allowing  it  to  be  stored  in  etcd  and  then  failing  the  validation  during  sync?

| What  is  the  max  machineSet  deletions  that  you  could  process  in  a  single  run?

Which  means  it  blocks  till  the  machineset  deletion  is  triggered  which  then  also  deletes  the  machines  (due  to  cascade-delete  and  blockOwnerDeletion=  true)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | pkg/controller/deployment.go - terminateMachineSets               | pending |
| If  there  are  validation  errors  or  error  when  creating  label  selector  then  a  nil  is  returned.
